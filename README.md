# Password Generator Starter Code
The purpose of this website is to randomly generate a password for the respective user. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user is promped with a series of questions to specify the length (8-128 characters) and the kinds of characters they would like used in their randomly generated password (ie uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). Once those questions are answered the password is randomly generated, pulling from a series of arrays in the code in order to do so.
